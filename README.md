Taught by Professor [Philip Sterne, Ph.D.](https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/people/philip-sterne/)

"This course is organized around the principle that the only way to learn software development is to develop software. We worked together as a team to develop a social media service. We had the opportunity to apply and experience all aspects of software development, including requirements analysis, design, planning, implementation, testing, and deployment."
